# PyCity Schools Analysis:

The [PyCitySchools_final.ipynb](#PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_final.ipynb) notebook examines the success rate of schools across one district to determine the effects of various factors upon student reading, math, and overall performance metrics. 

**1. District Summary** - Here, we establish a benchmark of the average performace and metrics across all 15 schools in the district as a comparison point for the subsequent analyses.  

**2. School Summary** - In this section, we explore the performance of each individual school across the district, highlighting the following metrics:
    
    a. School Type
    b. Total Students
    c. Total School Budget
    d. Per Student Budget
    e. Average Math Scores
    f. Average Reading Scores
    g. % Passing Math
    h. % Passing Reading
    i. % Overall Passing (combined math and reading scores)

From the School Summary analysis, we can proceed to rank the performance of each school by key metrics in the following 2 sections:

**3. Highest-Performing Schools** (by % Overall Passing) - This section outlines the 5 top performing schools in the district as indicated by overall passing percentage.

**4. Bottom Performing Schools** (By % Overall Passing) - This section outlines the 5 lowest performing schools in the district as indicated by overall passing percentage.

The following 2 sections examine performance in reference to grade level across each school:

**5. Math Scores by Grade** - This section examines the average math scores from each school broken down by grade level 9-12.

**6. Reading Score by Grade** - This section examines the average reading scores from each school broken down by grade level 9-12.

The final 3 sections examine performance in refrence to specific key school metrics: funding, size and type.

**7. Scores by School Spending** - This section examines the performance of each school in the district and breaks down performance by per-student budget. Schools are grouped for comparison into four per-student budget ranges: <585, 585-630, 630-645, & 645-680. 

**8. Scores by School Size** - This section examines the role of school size on academic performance. Schools are grouped for comparison into the following categories: Small (<1000), Medium (1000-2000), Large (2000-5000).

**9. Scores by School Type** - The final section examines Distric vs. Charter school performance, comparing average scores in reading, math and overall performance.

**10. Final Conclusions** - This section summarizes all of the findings from the above analysis, and lists areas for further exploration.
